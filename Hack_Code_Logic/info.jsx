1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing
Ethical hackers use JavaScript to simulate how attackers could exploit XSS vulnerabilities.

What is XSS?
XSS allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page viewed by other users.

How Ethical Hackers Test for XSS: They inject scripts into input fields to test whether the application sanitizes or escapes user input.

Example of a payload:


<script>alert('XSS Test');</script>





Ethical hackers, also known as white-hat hackers, use JavaScript to test and secure web applications against vulnerabilities. Their goal is to identify and fix security issues before malicious attackers can exploit them. Here are ways ethical hackers use JavaScript in their work:

1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing
Ethical hackers use JavaScript to simulate how attackers could exploit XSS vulnerabilities.

What is XSS?
XSS allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page viewed by other users.

How Ethical Hackers Test for XSS: They inject scripts into input fields to test whether the application sanitizes or escapes user input.

Example of a payload:

javascript
Copy
Edit
<script>alert('XSS Test');</script>
If this script executes, it indicates an XSS vulnerability.

2. Testing for Insecure APIs
JavaScript is often used to interact with APIs in web applications. Ethical hackers use tools like Postman, Burp Suite, or browser developer tools to test API endpoints for vulnerabilities such as:

Exposed sensitive data
Broken authentication
Improper access control
Example: Testing a poorly secured API using JavaScript in the browser console:


fetch('https://example.com/api/userdata', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer insecure-token' }
  })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data));

    
    3. Simulating Client-Side Attacks
Ethical hackers use JavaScript to check for client-side vulnerabilities, such as:

DOM-based XSS: Testing if the DOM is manipulated unsafely:
javascript
Copy
Edit


let input = "<img src=x onerror=alert('DOM XSS')>";
document.body.innerHTML = input; // Unsafe if input isn't sanitized

Clickjacking: Creating an invisible iframe to simulate a click

const iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
iframe.src = 'https://example.com';
iframe.style.opacity = 0;
document.body.appendChild(iframe);

4. Session Hijacking

Ethical hackers use JavaScript to assess whether session cookies are properly secured. They test for:

Lack of HttpOnly flag:
If a cookie isnâ€™t marked as HttpOnly, it can be accessed via JavaScript.

console.log(document.cookie); // Shouldn't reveal sensitive cookies

5. Automating Reconnaissance

Ethical hackers often automate tasks like gathering information about a website using JavaScript:

[...document.querySelectorAll('a')].map(link => link.href);






Tools Ethical Hackers Use with JavaScript
Browser Developer Tools: For manual testing.
Node.js: For scripting automated attacks.
TamperMonkey/Greasemonkey: To run custom JavaScript on specific websites.
Burp Suite: For intercepting and modifying
